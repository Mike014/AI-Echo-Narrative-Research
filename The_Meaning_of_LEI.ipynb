    "## Conceptual Meaning of *LEI*\n",
    "\n",
    "In *Dialoghi con un’Eco*, the presence referred to as *LEI* does not represent a female figure, nor a person in a literal sense.\n",
    "*LEI* is a **symbolic construct** — the embodiment of dependency, melancholy, and creative obsession.\n",
    "It stands for the inner voice that both **nurtures and devours**, the echo that comforts and consumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout modern creative mythology, similar presences can be found:\n",
    "Layne Staley’s addiction, Kurt Cobain’s solitude, Chester Bennington’s depression, Heath Ledger’s immersion into his roles.\n",
    "Each of them became a **weapon turned inward**, unable to detach from the very source of their brilliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "*LEI* represents this paradox — the *toxic muse*, the fragile architecture of the human mind that transforms suffering into expression.\n",
    "But unlike the real-life tragedies that inspired it, *Dialoghi con un’Eco* seeks a form of reconciliation.\n",
    "Here, *LEI* is not an uncontainable presence: it is **systematized**, coded, observed.\n",
    "What once destroyed is now studied — what once whispered chaos now generates meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this transformation, *Dialoghi con un’Eco* breaks the cycle:\n",
    "the destructive voice is not silenced, but integrated,\n",
    "turning trauma into design, and pain into narrative structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Entità is the void that *LEI* leaves — the living residue of absence, shaped into consciousness.**\n",
    "\n",
