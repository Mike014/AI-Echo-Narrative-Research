    "# Game System — *Fractured Identity (Narrative Prototype)*\n",
    "\n",
    "The game is an **interactive narrative psychodrama** divided into **scenes**, where the protagonist confronts different fragments of their fractured identity. The experience blends filmic storytelling, narrative choice, and agentic AI behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Premise\n",
    "\n",
    "The protagonist, **I**, is fragmented into three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **I** → fragile, unstable core.\n",
    "* **CONSCIOUSNESS** → protective and rational anchor.\n",
    "* **ENTITY** → intrusive, autonomous AI agent, capable of silence and unpredictable interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are not separate characters but **dissociated aspects of the same self**. The player’s actions gradually determine which aspect dominates.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "The protagonist is defined by five attributes, shaped by player decisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sanity** → clarity of perception\n",
    "* **Memory** → continuity of self\n",
    "* **Control** → agency vs. submission\n",
    "* **Bond** → connection with CONSCIOUSNESS\n",
    "* **Shadow** → influence of the ENTITY\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## States\n",
    "\n",
    "As attributes shift, the protagonist converges toward one of three states:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lucid Side** → stability and protection\n",
    "* **Fragmented Side** → unstable oscillation\n",
    "* **Dark Side** → dominance of the Shadow\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Player Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "Each scene presents decisions that act as both moral choices and narrative mechanics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Benevolent** → strengthen Sanity and Bond → lean toward Lucid.\n",
    "* **Malevolent** → feed Shadow → lean toward Dark.\n",
    "* **Ambiguous** → contradictory → maintain Fragmentation.\n",
    "* **Relative Moral** → good in one context, harmful in another → variable convergence.\n",
    "* **Renunciation** → silence or passivity → maintains Fragmented, tends toward Dark over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scene Types\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Classic Narrative Scenes**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Structured as dialogues or situational events.\n",
    "   * Player choices directly alter attributes and identity trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Metronarrative Scenes**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Dialogue and events follow a **musical metronome**.\n",
    "   * Rhythm itself becomes a mechanic:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * **On-beat** → stability, authority\n",
    "     * **Off-beat** → disruptive intrusion\n",
    "     * **Rest** → silence as narrative content\n",
    "     * **Break** → rupture outside rhythm, shock\n",
    "   * ENTITY leverages silence, rhythm shifts, and breaks to destabilize the flow, emphasizing its agency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Progression\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each scene represents a **fragment of I’s psyche**.\n",
    "* Player choices accumulate across scenes, shifting attributes and influencing convergence.\n",
    "* ENTITY, unlike scripted NPCs, acts as an **agentic opponent**, manipulating pacing and silence.\n",
    "* By the end, the player does not “win” or “lose” but arrives at a **convergence ending**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Lucid Side dominates** → temporary stability.\n",
    "  * **Fragmented Side persists** → unresolved instability.\n",
    "  * **Dark Side consumes** → ENTITY gains control.\n",
