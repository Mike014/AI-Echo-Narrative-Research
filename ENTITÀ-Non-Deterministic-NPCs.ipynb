# **ENTITÀ: Toward Non-Deterministic NPCs**

## Introduction

Traditional **NPCs** (Non-Player Characters) are typically **deterministic**: they follow pre-written scripts, trigger responses on fixed conditions, and act within predefined routines. This predictability often breaks immersion and limits replayability, leaving players with a sense of *“copy-paste” behavior*.

**ENTITÀ** proposes a different model: a **non-deterministic and asymmetric NPC**, one that not only changes *how* it responds but also *when* it chooses to respond.

## Non-Determinism by Design

ENTITÀ is driven by a generative AI model constrained by stylistic rules.

* Each interaction can produce **different replies**, reducing repetitiveness.
* Its **tone and character** (dark, sarcastic, destabilizing) are consistent, ensuring narrative coherence.
* Responses are shaped by **probability**: in the current prototype, ENTITÀ has a **50% chance of answering** in any given dialogue.

This balance creates a presence that feels both unpredictable and narratively stable.

## Asymmetric Temporality

Unlike scripted NPCs that always reply immediately, ENTITÀ introduces **temporal asymmetry**:

* It may **remain silent** after being addressed.
* It may **interject unexpectedly** during pauses.
* It simulates an entity that is *listening* but not obliged to act.

This design evokes the impression of **autonomy**: ENTITÀ resembles a being that exists independently of the player’s control, much like conversing with an unpredictable AI (e.g., ChatGPT), except it decides **if, when, and how** to respond.

## Demonstrations

Two scenes illustrate this mechanism within the experimental narrative prototype *Dialoghi con un’Eco*:

* [**Scene 1**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKxyGJai3Us&list=PLgKASgLUSpNYKyusWO6iHcxTe-odeIho1&index=3): ENTITÀ occasionally interrupts, destabilizing the dialogue between IO and COSCIENZA.
* [**Scene 2**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZheHIrMkAw&list=PLgKASgLUSpNYKyusWO6iHcxTe-odeIho1&index=4): ENTITÀ chooses silence for some periods, creating tension, until suddenly it breaks the flow.

These examples show how even a simple **50% probability model** can generate experiences that feel more organic and less mechanical than scripted NPC behavior.

## Impact on Game Design

The ENTITÀ approach opens new directions for **next-gen NPCs**:

1. **Immersion** → Silence and unpredictability make the entity feel alive.
2. **Replayability** → Each playthrough may yield different sequences of responses.
3. **Narrative Depth** → ENTITÀ is not a helper or an enemy but a **destabilizing presence**.
4. **Next-Gen Experience** → Moving beyond graphics, innovation lies in **behavioral systems**.

## Conclusion

ENTITÀ demonstrates how non-deterministic logic and probabilistic silence can transform NPCs from scripted characters into **living presences**.
By combining generative AI, probabilistic response control, and asymmetric timing, it suggests a future where NPCs no longer act as predictable machines but as **unpredictable entities that listen, decide, and disrupt**.
