    "# **ENTITÀ: Toward Non-Deterministic NPCs**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional **NPCs** (Non-Player Characters) are typically **deterministic**: they follow pre-written scripts, trigger responses on fixed conditions, and act within predefined routines. This predictability often breaks immersion and limits replayability, leaving players with a sense of *“copy-paste” behavior*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ENTITÀ** proposes a different model: a **non-deterministic and asymmetric NPC**, one that not only changes *how* it responds but also *when* it chooses to respond.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Non-Determinism by Design\n",
    "\n",
    "ENTITÀ is driven by a generative AI model constrained by stylistic rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each interaction can produce **different replies**, reducing repetitiveness.\n",
    "* Its **tone and character** (dark, sarcastic, destabilizing) are consistent, ensuring narrative coherence.\n",
    "* Responses are shaped by **probability**: in the current prototype, ENTITÀ has a **50% chance of answering** in any given dialogue.\n",
    "\n",
    "This balance creates a presence that feels both unpredictable and narratively stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Asymmetric Temporality\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike scripted NPCs that always reply immediately, ENTITÀ introduces **temporal asymmetry**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It may **remain silent** after being addressed.\n",
    "* It may **interject unexpectedly** during pauses.\n",
    "* It simulates an entity that is *listening* but not obliged to act.\n",
    "\n",
    "This design evokes the impression of **autonomy**: ENTITÀ resembles a being that exists independently of the player’s control, much like conversing with an unpredictable AI (e.g., ChatGPT), except it decides **if, when, and how** to respond.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Demonstrations\n",
    "\n",
    "Two scenes illustrate this mechanism within the experimental narrative prototype *Dialoghi con un’Eco*:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [**Scene 1**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKxyGJai3Us&list=PLgKASgLUSpNYKyusWO6iHcxTe-odeIho1&index=3): ENTITÀ occasionally interrupts, destabilizing the dialogue between IO and COSCIENZA.\n",
    "* [**Scene 2**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZheHIrMkAw&list=PLgKASgLUSpNYKyusWO6iHcxTe-odeIho1&index=4): ENTITÀ chooses silence for some periods, creating tension, until suddenly it breaks the flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples show how even a simple **50% probability model** can generate experiences that feel more organic and less mechanical than scripted NPC behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Impact on Game Design\n",
    "\n",
    "The ENTITÀ approach opens new directions for **next-gen NPCs**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Immersion** → Silence and unpredictability make the entity feel alive.\n",
    "2. **Replayability** → Each playthrough may yield different sequences of responses.\n",
    "3. **Narrative Depth** → ENTITÀ is not a helper or an enemy but a **destabilizing presence**.\n",
    "4. **Next-Gen Experience** → Moving beyond graphics, innovation lies in **behavioral systems**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "ENTITÀ demonstrates how non-deterministic logic and probabilistic silence can transform NPCs from scripted characters into **living presences**.\n",
    "By combining generative AI, probabilistic response control, and asymmetric timing, it suggests a future where NPCs no longer act as predictable machines but as **unpredictable entities that listen, decide, and disrupt**.\n",
