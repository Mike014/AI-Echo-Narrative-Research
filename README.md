# AI Echo Narrative Research

**Independent Research Project**

## Overview

This repository documents an **independent research project** at the intersection of **AI, game design, and digital narrative**.

The project originates from the experimental prototype *Dialoghi con un’Eco*, evolving into what can be described as a **digital psychodrama**: an interactive system where the player’s choices shape not only the story but the very **fragmentation of the protagonist’s identity**.

At its core lies the **ENTITY**, not a scripted NPC but an **agentic AI agent** equipped with a *Temporal Controller*. Unlike traditional NPCs, ENTITY can **choose when to respond or remain silent**, making **absence** as significant as speech. This creates a form of **non-deterministic agency**, breaking away from predictable chatbot-like behaviors.

Two novel design components are central to this research:

* **Entity Brain + Temporal Controller** → defines ENTITY’s logic of silence, timing, and mood-based interventions.
* **Metronarrative framework** → a narrative system synchronized with a musical beat grid, where silence, rhythm, and breaks become part of storytelling.

The **engine already exists and functions**: ENTITY responds autonomously, the *Entity Director* interacts with the OS sandbox, and the metronarrative scenes are operational. What remains under development is the **game design articulation** — transforming these experimental mechanics into a fully realized narrative experience.

This repository, and its preprint on **Zenodo** (with ~100 downloads), frames the project explicitly as **research**, positioned between AI experimentation, interactive fiction, and game design methodology.

## Inspiration

Directly inspired by **Black Mirror: Bandersnatch** (2018).

Like *Bandersnatch*, it blurs:

* story and choice,
* reality and simulation,
* control and illusion of agency.

The **ENTITY** is influenced by Pax from Bandersnatch, but designed as an **AI-powered character** with:

* **Agency** → speaks only when it chooses
* **Personality** → cryptic, reflective, sometimes silent
* **Unpredictability** → mood-driven responses rather than deterministic logic

---

## Research Scope

This repository functions as both **case study and experimental lab**, exploring:

1. **Entity Modeling**

   * ENTITY as an agent, not a chatbot
   * Silence as a deliberate choice

2. **Narrative & Agency**

   * Choice-driven progression
   * Convergence toward Lucid, Fragmented, or Dark states

3. **Atmosphere & Immersion**

   * Metronarrative rhythm-based design
   * Glitch, silence, and audio layers as narrative devices

4. **Comparative & Theoretical References**

   * *Bandersnatch* (Netflix)
   * Generative Agents (Stanford, 2023)
   * Procedural narrative generation (*PANGeA, arXiv 2404.19721*)
   * Symbolic storytelling (*The Dream Within Huang Long Cave, arXiv 2504.04968*)
