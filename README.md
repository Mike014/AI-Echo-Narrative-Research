# AI Echo Narrative Research

**Independent Research Project**

## Overview

This repository documents an **independent research prototype** at the intersection of **AI (agentic AI), game design, digital narrative, sound design, poetry, and psychology**.

The work originates from *Dialoghi con un’Eco* and evolves into a **digital psychodrama** where **ENTITY**—not a scripted NPC but an **agentic AI**—can **choose when to speak or remain silent**. A **Temporal Controller** (multi-scale EMA, hysteresis, cooldown) turns **time and silence** into first-class mechanics, avoiding chatbot-style reactivity.

Three core components anchor the prototype:

* **Entity Brain + Temporal Controller** — governs silence/speech decisions, timing, and mood-biased interventions.
* **Metronarrative framework** — scenes aligned to a beat/tempo grid where rhythm, pauses, and breaks carry narrative meaning.
* **Entity Director (real-time notifications & paratext)** — an external orchestrator that reads dialog context, scores emotional channels, and triggers **sandboxed** side-effects (desktop-style note lines, guaranteed in-game toasts, optional OS-aware toasts) with **cooldowns** and **de-duplication**.

The **engine is functional**: ENTITY reacts autonomously, metronarrative scenes run end-to-end, and the **Entity Director** coordinates real-time side effects safely. What’s still in progress is the **game-design articulation** (core loop, player verbs, onboarding) to turn the research system into a fully playable slice.

### Recent engine updates

* **Neural TTS voice for ENTITY**
  A new voice pipeline (Neural TTS + light post-FX) delivers a **hybrid timbre**—influenced by Heath Ledger’s Joker (attack/taunt) and grunge textures (Layne Staley, Kurt Cobain). Result: **more fluid laugh transitions** and a darker, controlled **single-sentence** delivery.

* **Environment detection (“establish environment”)**
  Runtime detection of **OS and screen resolution/DPI** to:

  * scale UI safely across displays,
  * enable **OS-aware affordances** in a **sandboxed** manner (simulate notes/overlays in-game when **Safe Mode** is on),
  * log session metadata (`os`, `resolution`, `dpi`) for tuning.

> Status: suitable for a **mini-demo** (engine-first). Next steps: packaging, safe defaults, and a clearer core loop.

### 7) Safety, Ethics & Content Guidelines

* **Intent & Framing**
  *Portray loneliness, intrusive thoughts, and self-destructive ideation **without glamorization**; emphasize consequences and limits.*
* **Diegetic Safeguards**
  *Within the story, COSCIENZA enforces **boundaries, pauses, escalation limits**; ENTITÀ’s pressure is contextualized, not celebrated.*
* **Alternatives & Agency**
  *Show **de-escalation choices** (contact, delay, routine) even if the protagonist refuses them; keep agency visible.*
* **Language**
  *Avoid sensational detail; use **clear, clinical phrasing** for harm-related content.*
* **Signals & Warnings**
  *Provide **content notes** and opt-outs for sensitive sequences.*
* **Resources (Credits/Appendix)**
  *Link to **support resources** and hotlines relevant to your audience.*
* **Testing & Review**
  *Use sensitivity readers / trusted peers to catch unintended glamorization or harm.*
* **Documentation**
  *Keep an ethics changelog: why a scene exists, what function it serves, what safeguards are in place.*

## Inspiration

Directly inspired by **Black Mirror: Bandersnatch** (2018).

Like *Bandersnatch*, it blurs:

* story and choice,
* reality and simulation,
* control and the **illusion** of agency.

**ENTITY** is influenced by Pax but designed as an **AI-powered character** with:

* **Agency** → speaks only when it chooses
* **Personality** → cryptic, restrained, sometimes silent
* **Unpredictability** → mood-driven responses rather than deterministic logic

---

## Research Scope

This repository functions as both **case study and experimental lab**, exploring:

1. **Entity Modeling** — ENTITY as an agent, not a chatbot; **silence as deliberate choice**.
2. **Narrative & Agency** — choice-driven progression; convergence toward **Lucid**, **Fragmented**, or **Dark** states.
3. **Atmosphere & Immersion** — metronarrative rhythm; glitch, silence, and audio layers as narrative devices.
4. **Comparative & Theoretical References** — *Bandersnatch*; Generative Agents (Stanford, 2023); procedural narrative (*PANGeA, arXiv 2404.19721*); symbolic storytelling (*The Dream Within Huang Long Cave, arXiv 2504.04968*).
