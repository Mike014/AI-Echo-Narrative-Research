# AI Echo Narrative Research

**Independent Research Project**

## Overview

This repository presents an **independent research project** on AI-driven interactive narratives,  
developed from the experimental prototype **[Dialoghi con un’Eco](https://github.com/Mike014?tab=repositories)**.

The research explores how **generative AI** and **interactive storytelling** can simulate  
a *conscious, mysterious digital entity* — a presence that observes, listens,  
and chooses when (or if) to respond.

## Origin: *Dialoghi con un’Eco*

**Dialoghi con un’Eco** is an experimental interactive narrative built with **Python** and **Pygame**,
featuring a fine-tuned GPT-2 model as the *Entity*.

* **Concept**: text-driven psychological interaction.
* **Environment**: minimal room, ambient soundscapes, glitch aesthetics.
* **Mechanism**: at narrative breakpoints, the Entity replies through a generative model.
* **Tone**: output prioritizes *mood and atmosphere* rather than factual accuracy.
* **Audio**: all sound design (ambient loops, glitch effects, final voice cues) composed by Michele Grimaldi.

The result is **minimal yet conceptually dense**:
a digital echo chamber where the user questions whether they are conversing with themselves
or with something darker that *inhabits the system*.

## Inspiration

The project is directly inspired by **Black Mirror: Bandersnatch** (Netflix, 2018).

In *Bandersnatch*, the audience experiences a narrative that blurs:

* story and choice,
* reality and simulation,
* control and the illusion of agency.

A particular influence comes from the **Entity** in Bandersnatch —
an unseen force that manipulates the protagonist’s path.

This led to the idea of an **AI-powered digital Entity** behaving not as a chatbot,
but as a *character* with:

* **agency** (it speaks only when it chooses),
* **personality** (cryptic, reflective, sometimes silent),
* **unpredictability** (responses shaped by mood, not deterministic logic).

## Research Scope

This repository functions as a **case study and comparative analysis**,
exploring how AI can enrich interactive fiction through:

1. **Entity Modeling**

   * Fine-tuned GPT-2 acting as narrative agent.
   * Context-aware but mood-driven responses.

2. **Narrative & Agency**

   * Choice-driven progression.
   * AI decides when to respond or remain silent.

3. **Atmosphere & Immersion**

   * Minimal text enhanced with ambient audio.
   * Glitch, silence, and soundscape as narrative devices.

4. **Comparative References**

   * *Bandersnatch* (Netflix interactive cinema).
   * Procedural narrative generation (*PANGeA, arXiv 2404.19721*).
   * Symbolic and reflective storytelling (*The Dream Within Huang Long Cave, arXiv 2504.04968*).
