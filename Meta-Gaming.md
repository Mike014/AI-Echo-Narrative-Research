## What is *Meta Gaming*?

**General Definition**

* In game design, *meta gaming* is the act of using **information outside the game** (that the character shouldn't know) to influence decisions and strategies **inside the game**.
* It breaks the *suspension of disbelief*: the player uses what they know as a player, not what the character knows.

## Practical Examples

* In a tabletop RPG: a player knows that goblins have low HP, so their character attacks "knowing" this information, even if the character has never encountered them.
* In video games: replaying *Bandersnatch* knowing which choices lead to certain endings → the player acts "out of character".
* In e-sports: studying the **meta** = the most used/effective strategies of the moment, even if they aren't "in-game knowledge" of your avatar.

## Types of *Meta Gaming*

1. **Illicit / Destructive** → breaks immersion (e.g., cheating in an RPG).
2. **Strategic / Competitive** → in online games, “the meta” indicates the dominant strategy (*most effective tactic available*).
3. **Narrative / Aware** → when the player becomes aware that they are “playing” and this is part of the narrative (*Bandersnatch*, *Undertale*).

## Connection with *Dialogues with an Echo*

The game, like *Bandersnatch*, **plays on narrative meta gaming**:

* The player understands that they are not fully in control.
* The Entity breaks the rules of dialogue, choosing when to speak → makes them feel that there is “something beyond the game.”
* In practice, you transform the gaming meta from a “bug” or “trick” to a **narrative element**: the player doesn't know whether he is communicating with the game, with himself, or with an external power.
