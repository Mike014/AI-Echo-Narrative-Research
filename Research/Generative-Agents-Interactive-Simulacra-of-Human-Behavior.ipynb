    "The paper **introduces generative agents**, virtual characters that **simulate believable human behavior**. They are not simple chatbots: they live in a simulated world, wake up, talk, work, remember experiences, and plan for the future.\n",

    "**The architecture is based on a LLM** enriched with three functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Memory** (recording experiences),\n",
    "2. **Reflection** (abstracting memories),\n",
    "3. **Planning** (using memories to act).\n",

    "In a Sims-style experiment with 25 agents, from a single input (\"I want to organize a Valentine's Day party\"), the agents spread the news, invited others, made appointments, and participated together.\n",

    "The authors situate their work within the literature on human-AI interaction and the historic but complex efforts to create agents that credibly simulate human behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Human-AI Interaction**: For decades, efforts have been made to enable users to influence and train models.\n",
    "* **Historical examples**: Crayons (interactive ML), SHRDLU, ELIZA (first natural language interactions).\n",
    "* **Evolution**: systems based on examples/demonstrations, up to prompt authoring and deep learning.\n",
    "* **Agents and Natural Language**: Today, the technology is mature enough for autonomous agents that communicate in natural language in complex online social environments.\n",
    "* **Opportunities**: Natural language becomes a means to enhance human skills in various domains (photo editing, code editing).\n",
    "\n",
    "This line of research reopens classic **HCI questions** (cognitive models, prototyping tools, ubiquitous computing), showing that with LLMs, when integrated with the right architecture, it is possible to build agents that act as credible proxies of human behavior.\n"

    "1. **Rule-based** (finite-state machines, behavior trees):\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* They integrate short-term/long-term memory and perception-planning-action cycles.\n",
