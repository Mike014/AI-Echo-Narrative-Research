    "# Hacker — Extended Definition & Operational Mind-Map\n",
    "\n",
    "## What a hacker is\n",
    "\n",
    "A **hacker** is a person with deep technical understanding of systems (hardware, software, networks) who explores and tests their limits to solve problems in non-conventional ways. Historically the term described a mindset of curiosity and mastery (see classic hacker culture); the modern pejorative meaning—“criminal”—is only one subset of the broader concept.\n",
    "Ethical categories describe intent, not skill: **white-hat (ethical)** — tests with permission to improve security; **gray-hat** — may operate without explicit consent but not primarily to harm; **black-hat** — acts for illicit gain or damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What hackers do (conceptually)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Map **assets** and the **attack surface**.\n",
    "* Model **threats** and identify **vulnerabilities**.\n",
    "* Demonstrate impact and translate findings into **risk** (probability × impact) and practical remediation.\n",
    "* In ethical contexts, operate under **scope** and rules of engagement and produce evidence-backed reports.\n",
    "* Malicious actors aim at data/theft, extortion, sabotage, or espionage; ethical actors aim at risk reduction and resilience.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Typical initial access vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Social engineering / phishing** (human trickery).\n",
    "* **Compromised credentials** (password reuse, credential stuffing, brute force).\n",
    "* **Unpatched software / zero-days.**\n",
    "* **Misconfigurations** (open storage, overly permissive IAM).\n",
    "* **Exposed services** (RDP, VPN, admin panels).\n",
    "* **Supply-chain compromises** (malicious updates or vendor compromise).\n",
    "* **Physical/insider access** (USBs, badges, direct access).\n",
    "\n",
    "After initial access attackers typically pursue **persistence**, **privilege escalation**, **lateral movement**, and finally actions on objectives (exfiltration, sabotage, ransom).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodologies and frameworks to structure thinking\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cyber Kill Chain (Lockheed Martin)** — attacker-centric sequence: Reconnaissance → Weaponization → Delivery → Exploitation → Installation → Command & Control → Actions on Objective. Useful to decide where to interrupt attacks.\n",
    "* **MITRE ATT&CK** — taxonomy of real-world tactics and techniques; essential for mapping observed behavior to detection and mitigations.\n",
    "* **PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard)** — practical ethical test workflow: pre-engagement → intelligence gathering → vulnerability analysis → exploitation → post-exploitation → reporting.\n",
    "* **NIST CSF (and CSF 2.0)** — governance and risk management: Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover. Use to link technical controls to business risk.\n",
    "* **Unified Kill Chain / advanced models** — blend of Kill Chain and ATT&CK for describing complex APT and ransomware campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Malware & ransomware — high-level concepts (non-operational)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Malware**: software designed to compromise confidentiality, integrity or availability. Common classes: Trojans, Worms, Spyware/Keyloggers, Backdoors, Rootkits, Botnets. Typical components: payload, persistence, C2, and anti-detection/evasion.\n",
    "* **Ransomware**: malware that encrypts data (often after exfiltrating it) and demands payment. Typical lifecycle: initial access → execution → network discovery → credential harvesting & escalation → lateral movement → exfiltration (often) → encryption → ransom demand.\n",
    "* **Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)**: an ecosystem where developers provide panels, payloads and infrastructure to affiliates, who execute attacks for revenue share. This industrializes and professionalizes extortion operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core defensive measures (quick checklist)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Govern & Risk**: roles, policies, supply-chain risk, risk appetite.\n",
    "* **Continuous patching & hardening** for OS, apps, firmware; enforce **MFA** and secrets management.\n",
    "* **Least privilege** and network segmentation to shrink attack surface.\n",
    "* **Strong backups (3-2-1)** with offline/immutable copies and regular restore tests.\n",
    "* **Monitoring & detection**: centralized logs, EDR, SIEM, telemetry mapped to ATT&CK.\n",
    "* **Email defense & user training** to reduce social engineering success.\n",
    "* **Vulnerability management** and asset inventory.\n",
    "* **Incident response playbooks** and regular tabletop/exercise drills.\n",
    "* Embrace **Zero Trust** principles: verify continuously; don’t trust implicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Minimal glossary (objects & concepts to recall)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Asset**: anything of value (data, systems, identities).\n",
    "* **Attack surface**: collection of reachable entry points.\n",
    "* **Threat**: actor or event that can cause harm.\n",
    "* **Vulnerability**: weakness that can be exploited.\n",
    "* **Exploit**: technique used to take advantage of a vulnerability.\n",
    "* **Risk**: likelihood × consequence.\n",
    "* **Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Lateral Movement, C2 (Command & Control), Exfiltration.**\n",
    "* **IoC**: Indicator of Compromise (artifact showing compromise).\n",
    "* **TTP**: Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (how adversaries operate).\n",
    "* **Defense-in-Depth**: layered security controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical, copy-ready summary (short)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition**: A hacker is a technically skilled problem-solver who probes systems’ limits; “black-hat” is a criminal subset, while “white-hat” is the ethical practitioner.\n",
    "* **Initial access**: social engineering, stolen creds, unpatched software, misconfigurations, exposed services, supply-chain or physical access.\n",
    "* **Method**: think in terms of **Kill Chain** (where to stop attackers), **ATT&CK** (what techniques they use), **PTES** (how ethical tests are run), and **NIST CSF** (how to govern and recover).\n",
    "* **Ransomware**: top threat vector — access → spread → exfiltrate → encrypt → extort; RaaS lowers attacker barrier.\n",
    "* **Defense essentials**: governance, patching, MFA, least privilege, segmentation, backup strategy, detection/telemetry, IR playbooks, training.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ethical & legal note\n",
    "\n",
    "Use these capabilities **only** on equipment you own or where you have explicit, written authorization. In professional contexts, document scope and evidence. Aim to apply knowledge toward protection and resilience rather than harm.\n",
