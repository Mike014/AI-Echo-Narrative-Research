    "## Key areas\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Online Information Gathering (OSINT / passive reconnaissance)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Public data: official sites and subdomains, public IPs (including cloud hosts), leaked internal IPs, leaked credentials (GitHub/Pastebin), past breaches, major business events (M&A), financial details, business phone numbers, employee info, social media activity (LinkedIn, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Social Engineering**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Exploits human psychology (phishing, credential harvesting, realistic scenarios) to reveal human-factor vulnerabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Network Host Scanning**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Purpose: map active hosts, open ports, services, and estimate operating systems.\n",
    "   * Stages: host discovery → port scanning → service enumeration → OS fingerprinting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main tools (Kali)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **OSINT / Automation**\n",
    "\n",

    "  * **Recon-ng** — modular framework for automated domain reconnaissance.\n",
    "  * **Maltego** — graph-based visualization of relationships for OSINT and forensics.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Social Engineering**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **SET (Social Engineering Toolkit)** — craft phishing campaigns, clone websites, create payloads; supports delivery methods like email or USB.\n",

    "  * **arp-scan** — map IP↔MAC on a LAN for host discovery.\n",
    "  * **nmap / zenmap** — TCP/UDP/SYN scans, service enumeration, and OS fingerprinting (Zenmap provides a GUI).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ethics & legality\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Always** obtain explicit authorization from the network/asset owner. Follow laws and organizational policies when conducting reconnaissance or scans.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "* Information gathering is foundational for penetration testing.\n",
    "* **OSINT** can reveal extensive target details without direct interaction.\n",
    "* **Social engineering** targets people to bypass technical controls.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Digital Forensics\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital forensics is the process of **preserving, acquiring, documenting, analyzing, and interpreting** data from storage media and network traffic (laptops, desktops, mobile devices, public/private networks).\n",
    "It’s a natural extension of **ethical hacking**, helping investigators understand what happened, initiate incident response, and secure evidence from tampering.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Main Processes and Tools (Kali Linux)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1) Forensic Carving**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Purpose:** Extract file fragments without relying on file system metadata — useful when files are deleted, corrupted, or partially overwritten.\n",
    "* **Tools:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **MagicRescue:** Recovers deleted or damaged files based on unique signatures.\n",
    "  * **Scalpel:** Scans raw data to identify file headers/footers and reconstruct fragmented files.\n",
    "  * **Scrounge-NTFS:** Recovers data from damaged or deleted NTFS partitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2) Forensic Imaging**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Purpose:** Create exact, bit-by-bit copies of storage devices, preserving the original evidence.\n",
    "* **Tool:** **Guymager**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Performs **automated hashing** to verify image integrity (matching hashes = authentic copy).\n",
    "  * Supports **write blocker compatibility** to prevent accidental modifications.\n",
    "  * Handles multiple image formats and allows parallel imaging of several devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3) PDF Forensics**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Purpose:** Detect vulnerabilities, malware, and embedded malicious content in PDF files (e.g., JavaScript, attachments).\n",
    "* **Tools:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **PDFiD:** High-level triage tool that scans for suspicious elements without deep inspection.\n",
    "  * **PDF-Parser:** Provides detailed analysis, allowing extraction, search, and investigation of suspicious objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4) Sleuth Kit (TSK) Suite**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition:** A C library and set of command-line utilities for disk image analysis and file recovery.\n",

    "* **Use:** Core framework for evidence extraction and disk image analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices and Legal Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Anonymization / PII Protection:** Conceal personal or identifiable information (emails, IDs) to protect privacy and comply with regulations.\n",
    "* **Scope Definition:** Limit investigations strictly to **authorized systems and areas** to avoid illegal access or accidental damage to unrelated assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "\n",
    "* Digital forensics extends ethical hacking, enabling thorough investigation of data and network incidents.\n",
    "* **Forensic Carving** (MagicRescue, Scalpel, Scrounge-NTFS) recovers deleted or fragmented files from raw data.\n",
    "* **Forensic Imaging** with **Guymager** ensures perfect forensic copies through hashing and write-blocker support.\n",
    "* **PDF Forensics** (PDFiD, PDF-Parser) uncovers malware and hidden threats in document files.\n",
    "* **TSK/Autopsy** form a powerful foundation for disk image analysis and recovery.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Quick Overview**\n",
    "Social engineering research studies how attackers exploit human behaviour (trust, urgency, authority, curiosity) to obtain information or trigger actions that weaken security. The legitimate goal is to identify human-centric weaknesses and design training, policies, and technical controls to reduce risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Legal/Ethical Warning**\n",
    "Only conduct social engineering research with **explicit written authorization** that defines scope, limits and deliverables. Collect only public information unless the engagement permits interaction. Misuse (phishing real people, harvesting credentials, impersonation without consent) is illegal and unethical.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Search organization profiles (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, company site)**\n",

    "* **Event data:** Public events create realistic pretexts (invitations, registration confirmations) that could be mimicked by attackers.\n",
    "* **Key personnel exposure:** Executives and admins are high-value targets for spear-phishing and business-email compromise.\n",

    "* Prefer **passive collection** (public posts, archived pages, WHOIS data) unless interaction is authorized.\n",
    "* Log sources, timestamps and rationale for every datum collected; report findings with minimal exposure of personal data.\n",
    "* Avoid creating fake accounts, sending test phishing emails, or contacting employees unless explicitly allowed.\n",
    "* Deliver remediation focused on people + process + tech (training, verification procedures, email protections).\n",

    "**Recommended Mitigations / Controls**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Training & simulations** — Regular, authorized phishing simulations plus just-in-time coaching.\n",
    "* **Technical controls** — Enforce SPF/DKIM/DMARC, enforce MFA, monitor for account enumeration and anomalous logins.\n",
    "* **Operational policies** — Require out-of-band confirmation for financial or sensitive requests; limit public exposure of direct email addresses.\n",
    "* **Executive protections** — Higher security posture for VIPs (phishing-resistant MFA, dedicated secure channels, least-privilege).\n",
    "* **Event handling rules** — Official event communications only from verified domains and landing pages; publish verification guidance.\n",
