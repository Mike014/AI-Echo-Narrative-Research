    "# **What is Ethical Hacking**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethical Hacking is the practice of **thinking like an attacker to defend the system**, but within explicit ethical and legal boundaries (authorization, protective purpose, traceability). The difference with malicious hacking is not technical but intentional and regulatory: same tools, opposite purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Breaches aren't random events**: they arise from **structural weaknesses** (missing patches, weak credentials, exposed attack surfaces). Ethical hacking makes them visible and measurable before they become incidents, transforming the unknown into managed risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cycle is not a checklist, but a **cognitive strategy** that maps adversarial intelligence:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reconnaissance** – build a mental model of the target.\n",
    "- **Scanning/Enumeration** – expose the real surface (services, ports, versions).\n",
    "- **Controlled Exploitation** – securely validate the impact of hypotheses.\n",
    "- **Post-Exploitation Analysis** – understand scope and potential lateral movement.\n",
    "- **Reporting & Remediation** – translate technical evidence into mitigation and governance priorities.\n",
    "\n",

    "### **Motivations**: Attacks as a Function of Incentives\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hackers are not a single entity**: their intent and incentives vary. Typical (often overlapping) drivers are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Economic** (ransomware, credential theft).\n",
    "- **Ideological/hacktivism** (symbolic damage in protest).\n",
    "- **Espionage** (strategic/competitive advantage).\n",
    "- **Curiosity/expertise** (challenge seeking, underestimating legal risks).\n",
    "- **Retaliation/internal** sabotage (abuse of legitimate access).\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of risk, this diversity implies heterogeneous threats in terms of profile, timing, and impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Methodologies**: A Recurring Adversarial Intelligence\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Regardless of the motivations**, the workflow converges on the same pattern (mirroring ethical hacking, but with opposite goals):\n",
    "- **Reconnaissance (intelligence)** – build a model of the target (people, systems, processes).\n",
    "- **Scanning/Enumeration** – expose the real surface (ports, services, configurations).\n",
    "- **Access** – exploit the breach (vulnerabilities, credentials, supply chain).\n",
    "- **Maintenance** – persist (backdoor, RAT, living-off-the-land).\n",
    "- **Covering Tracks** – degrade visibility (log tampering, anti-forensics).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Defense**: From Event to System\n",
    "\n",
    "An effective preemptive strategy translates that workflow into lifecycle countermeasures:\n",
    "- **Informed prevention** (asset inventory, hardening, prioritized risk-based patching).\n",
    "- **Targeted detection** (useful telemetry, not \"noise\").\n",
    "- **Response and containment** (playbook, least privilege, segmentation).\n",
    "- **Lessons learned** → governance (metrics, accountability, reporting culture).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The WannaCry Case**\n",
    "\n",
    "Not just \"malware,\" but proof that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Patch management and known vulnerability management are factors of resilience, not bureaucracy.\n",
    "- Local negligence can scale to global impact.\n",
    "- Understanding techniques and the attack chain enables proportionate mitigations (prioritizing exposed/critical systems).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Framework**\n",
    "**Motivations** explain the attack, **methodologies** make it possible, **anticipation** makes it unlikely.\n",
    "Don't stop at the \"what\" (malware), work on how those who use it think.\n",
    "\n",
