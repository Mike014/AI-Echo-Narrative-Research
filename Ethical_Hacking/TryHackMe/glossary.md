# **Mini-Glossary: Cybersecurity & Networking**

### **A**

* **A Record** → DNS record that maps a domain name to an IPv4 address.
* **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)** → Resolves IP addresses into MAC addresses within a local network.
* **Attack (Offensive Security)** → Simulation of real hacker attacks to identify vulnerabilities and strengthen defenses.

### **C**

* **Cache (DNS Cache)** → Temporary storage for recently resolved domain names to speed up future lookups.
* **CNAME (Canonical Name)** → DNS record that creates an alias pointing one domain to another.
* **Cybersecurity** → The practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access or attacks.

### **D**

* **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** → Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network.
* **Defensive Security** → Branch of cybersecurity focused on protection, monitoring, and response to threats.
* **DNS (Domain Name System)** → Translates domain names (e.g., *google.com*) into numeric IP addresses.

### **E**

* **Ethical Hacker (Penetration Tester)** → Professional who performs authorized security testing to find vulnerabilities.

### **F**

* **Firewall** → Hardware or software system that filters network traffic based on security rules.
* **Forensics (Digital Forensics)** → Collection and analysis of digital evidence to understand how an incident occurred.

### **I**

* **Incident Responder** → Specialist who manages and mitigates security incidents.
* **IP (Internet Protocol)** → Unique numerical identifier for each device connected to a network.
* **IPSec (Internet Protocol Security)** → Protocol suite for encrypting and authenticating IP communications (used in VPNs).

### **L**

* **LAN (Local Area Network)** → Network that connects devices within a limited area (home, office, campus).
* **Log** → Recorded event or activity in a system, used for monitoring and investigation.

### **M**

* **Malware Analyst** → Expert who studies malicious software (malware) to understand how it works.
* **MX Record** → DNS record that specifies a domain’s mail servers and their priority.

### **N**

* **Network** → A group of connected devices that communicate using shared protocols.
* **Nameserver (Authoritative Server)** → Server that stores official DNS records for a domain.
* **Nmap** → Tool used to scan networks and discover open ports or running services.

### **P**

* **Packet** → Basic unit of data transmitted over a network.
* **Ping** → Command that tests connectivity to another host and measures latency (uses ICMP).
* **Port** → Numerical identifier for specific network services (e.g., 80 = HTTP, 443 = HTTPS).
* **Port Forwarding** → Redirects external traffic to an internal service or device through the router.
* **Protocol** → Set of rules that define how data is transmitted and interpreted between devices (e.g., TCP, UDP).

### **R**

* **Red Team** → Group simulating advanced, persistent attacks to test an organization’s defense and response.
* **Root Server** → Top-level DNS server that directs queries to the correct TLD server (e.g., .com, .org).
* **Router** → Device that connects multiple networks and directs packets to their destination.

### **S**

* **Security Engineer** → Builds and maintains an organization’s security infrastructure.
* **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** → System that collects and analyzes security logs from multiple sources.
* **SOC (Security Operations Center)** → Centralized team or facility that monitors and manages cybersecurity in real time.
* **Subnetting** → Division of a large network into smaller subnetworks for better control and efficiency.
* **Switch** → Device that connects multiple computers within a LAN and forwards data only to the correct device.

### **T**

* **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** → Reliable, connection-oriented protocol ensuring ordered and complete data delivery.
* **TLD (Top-Level Domain)** → The last part of a domain name (e.g., .com, .it, .org).
* **TTL (Time To Live)** → Time (in seconds) a DNS record stays cached before being refreshed.

### **U**

* **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** → Fast, connectionless protocol with minimal overhead (used for streaming, VoIP, gaming).

### **V**

* **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** → Encrypted tunnel that securely connects remote devices or networks over the Internet.
* **Vulnerability** → A weakness or flaw in a system that could be exploited by an attacker.
