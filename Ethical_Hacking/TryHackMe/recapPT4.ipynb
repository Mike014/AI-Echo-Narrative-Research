    "**DNS – Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition**\n",
    "  The **Domain Name System (DNS)** allows communication on the Internet without needing to remember numeric IP addresses.\n",
    "  Each device online has a unique **IP address** (e.g., `104.26.10.229`).\n",
    "  DNS acts like a **phone book**, translating human-readable names (e.g., *tryhackme.com*) into IP addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Domain Hierarchy**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TLD (Top-Level Domain)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The final part of a domain (e.g., `.com` in *tryhackme.com*).\n",
    "   * **gTLD:** generic domains (.com, .org, .edu, .gov).\n",
    "   * **ccTLD:** country-specific domains (.it, .uk, .ca).\n",
    "   * Thousands of new gTLDs exist (.online, .club, .biz, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Second-Level Domain**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The part just before the TLD (e.g., *tryhackme* in *tryhackme.com*).\n",
    "   * Up to 63 characters; can use letters, numbers, and hyphens (but not at the start, end, or consecutively).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Subdomain**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Comes before the main domain (e.g., *admin.tryhackme.com*).\n",
    "   * Follows the same rules as second-level domains.\n",
    "   * Multiple subdomains are allowed (e.g., *jupiter.servers.tryhackme.com*), but the total length must be under 253 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **DNS Record Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **A Record** – Maps a domain to an **IPv4 address**.\n",
    "2. **AAAA Record** – Maps a domain to an **IPv6 address**.\n",
    "3. **CNAME Record** – Points one domain to another (e.g., *store.tryhackme.com → shops.shopify.com*).\n",
    "4. **MX Record** – Specifies **mail servers** for a domain, including a **priority value** for failover.\n",
    "5. **TXT Record** – Stores free-form text data, used for:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Domain ownership verification.\n",
    "   * Email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) to prevent spam/spoofing.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **How a DNS Request Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Local Cache Check**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Your computer checks its local DNS cache first.\n",
    "   * If no match is found, it queries the **Recursive DNS Server** (usually your ISP).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Recursive DNS Server**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Checks its own cache.\n",
    "   * If no record is found, it contacts the **Root DNS Servers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Root DNS Servers**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Direct the query to the correct **TLD Server** (e.g., for `.com`, `.org`, `.it`, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **TLD Server**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Provides the location of the **Authoritative DNS Server** for the requested domain.\n",
    "   * Example: *kip.ns.cloudflare.com*, *uma.ns.cloudflare.com* for *tryhackme.com*.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Authoritative DNS Server**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Stores the official DNS records (A, MX, TXT, etc.).\n",
    "   * Sends the final answer back to the recursive server, which caches it (based on **TTL – Time To Live**) and returns it to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Caching and TTL**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **TTL** defines how long the record stays in cache (in seconds).\n",
    "   * Caching improves speed and reduces repeated DNS lookups.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "When you make a **DNS request**, your computer first looks for the address in its **local cache**.\n",
    "If it's not found, the request is passed to the **recursive DNS resolver** (usually provided by your ISP or one you've chosen yourself).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Recursive Resolver**: Checks its own cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   If it finds the address → it returns it immediately.\n",
    "    *   If it doesn't find it → it begins the search starting from the **root servers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Root Server**: Directs the request to the correct **TLD server** (e.g., for `.com`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **TLD Server**: Indicates which is the **authoritative nameserver** for the requested domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Authoritative Nameserver**: Contains the official **DNS records** (A, MX, CNAME, etc.) and sends them to the recursive resolver.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Caching**: The recursive resolver saves the response for a period defined by the **TTL (Time To Live)** value and then returns it to your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short:\n",
    "**PC → Recursive Resolver → Root → TLD → Authoritative → Recursive Resolver → PC**, with the results temporarily stored to avoid new lookups.\n",
