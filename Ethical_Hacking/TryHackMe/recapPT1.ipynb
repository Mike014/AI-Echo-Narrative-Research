    "# **General Summary: Cybersecurity - Concepts and Roles**\n",
    "\n",
    "The document outlines the fundamental principles of Offensive and Defensive Security, introduces basic tools, and describes key professional roles in the field of cybersecurity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Offensive Security**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To simulate hacker attacks to identify vulnerabilities, software bugs, and loopholes in systems, with the ultimate goal of strengthening defenses.\n",
    "- **Practical Example (Finding Hidden Pages)**:\n",
    "    - **Problem**: Publicly exposed administrative portals (e.g., `/bank-transfer`).\n",
    "    - **Tool**: `gobuster` for directory brute-forcing.\n",
    "    - **Command**: `gobuster -u http://fakebank.thm -w wordlist.txt dir`\n",
    "    - **Output Interpretation**:\n",
    "        - `Status: 200`: Accessible and potentially sensitive resource.\n",
    "        - `Status: 301/302`: Redirect.\n",
    "    - **Ethical Note**: Use these techniques only in authorized environments (labs, CTFs).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Defensive Security**\n",
    "- **Approach**: Proactive, aimed at protecting networks and systems.\n",
    "- **Main Objectives**:\n",
    "    - Prevent intrusions.\n",
    "    - Detect and respond quickly to incidents.\n",
    "- **Key Activities**:\n",
    "    - **Cyber Security Awareness**: Train users against threats like phishing.\n",
    "    - **Asset Management**: Inventory all systems to be protected.\n",
    "    - **Preventive Controls**: Firewalls, IPS, traffic rules.\n",
    "    - **Logging & Monitoring**: Collecting and analyzing logs to identify anomalies.\n",
    "    - **Policies & Procedures**: Define clear rules and processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Professional Roles in Cybersecurity**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **A. Security Operations Centre (SOC)**\n",
    "- **Mission**: To continuously monitor networks and systems for malicious activity.\n",
    "- **Areas of Work**:\n",
    "    - Staying updated on threats and vulnerabilities.\n",
    "    - Verifying violations of company policies.\n",
    "    - Detecting unauthorized activities and intrusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **B. Security Analyst**\n",
    "- **Function**: Bridge between business and technical teams.\n",
    "- **Responsibilities**:\n",
    "    - Analysis with stakeholders and continuous reporting.\n",
    "    - Designing security plans.\n",
    "    - Technical assessments and recommendations for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **C. Security Engineer**\n",
    "- **Mission**: Security \"builder.\" Designs and implements technical controls.\n",
    "- **Activities**:\n",
    "    - Testing, hardening, and patching systems.\n",
    "    - Managing tools like WAF, EDR, SIEM.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **D. Incident Responder**\n",
    "- **Mission**: Respond rapidly to breaches to minimize damage.\n",
    "- **Key Metrics (KPIs)**:\n",
    "    - **MTTD**: Mean Time To Detect.\n",
    "    - **MTTA**: Mean Time To Acknowledge.\n",
    "    - **MTTR**: Mean Time To Recover/Restore.\n",
    "- **Process Phases (IR)**:\n",
    "    1. **Preparation**: Prepare team, tools, and plans.\n",
    "    2. **Detection & Analysis**: Detect and analyze the incident.\n",
    "    3. **Containment, Eradication & Recovery**: Isolate, remove the threat, and restore services.\n",
    "    4. **Post-Incident Activity**: Lessons learned and plan updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **E. Digital Forensics Investigator**\n",
    "- **Mission**: \"Digital detective\" who collects and analyzes evidence.\n",
    "- **Objectives**: Reconstruct what, when, how, and who, while maintaining evidence integrity (chain of custody).\n",
    "- **Evidence Sources**: File systems, RAM memory, system and network logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **F. Malware Analyst / Reverse Engineer**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Understand the functionality of malicious programs.\n",
    "- **Analysis Types**:\n",
    "    - **Static**: Code analysis without execution (using disassemblers).\n",
    "    - **Dynamic**: Execution in a controlled environment (sandbox) to observe behavior.\n",
    "- **Output**: IOCs (Indicators of Compromise), detection rules (e.g., YARA), recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **G. Penetration Tester (Ethical Hacker)**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Find vulnerabilities through authorized, simulated testing.\n",
    "- **Output**: Vulnerability reports with priorities and remediation recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **H. Red Teamer**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Simulate sophisticated, persistent attacks to test an organization's detection and response capabilities.\n",
    "- **Difference from Pentesting**: Greater focus on persistence and evasion of defenses to test overall resilience.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Basic Networking Concepts**\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Syntax**: `ping <IP_or_hostname>`\n",
    "- **Output**: Shows sent/received packets and the round-trip time (RTT).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **D. Host Definition**\n",
    "- **What it is**: A device (PC, server, etc.) with an IP address, capable of sending and receiving data on the network. It is a communication \"endpoint.\"\n",
