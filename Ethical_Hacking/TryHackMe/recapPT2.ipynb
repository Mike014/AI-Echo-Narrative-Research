    "# **General Summary: Cybersecurity - Concepts and Roles**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. LAN – Main Topologies**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Star**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Description:** all devices are connected to a central device (switch or hub).\n",
    "* **Pros:** easy to expand (add nodes), reliable.\n",
    "* **Cons:** higher cost (more cables and devices); if the central node fails, the whole network stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Bus**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Description:** all devices share a single main cable (backbone).\n",
    "* **Pros:** cheap and easy to install.\n",
    "* **Cons:** one cable failure breaks the entire network; difficult to troubleshoot; low efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Ring (Token Ring)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Description:** devices are connected in a closed loop; each node passes data to the next.\n",
    "* **Pros:** less congestion than a bus; simple cabling.\n",
    "* **Cons:** unidirectional path → inefficient; one node or cable failure breaks the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Network Devices**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Switch**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What it does:** connects multiple devices and forwards data only to the correct destination port (using a MAC table).\n",
    "* **Typical use:** schools, offices, medium-to-large networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Router**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What it does:** connects different networks (e.g., LAN to Internet) and determines the best path for packets.\n",
    "* **Redundancy:** multiple switches/routers can be linked for fault tolerance — if one link fails, traffic uses an alternate path (minor performance drop, but no downtime).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Subnetting – Key Concept**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition:** dividing a large network into smaller subnetworks (subnets).\n",
    "* **Purpose:** better **organization, efficiency, security, and traffic control.**\n",
    "* **Tool:** **subnet mask** (32 bits) defines the network and host portions of an IP.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Main Addresses**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type            | Purpose                               | Example       |\n",
    "| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------- |\n",
    "| Network address | Identifies the network                | 192.168.1.0   |\n",
    "| Host address    | Identifies a device within the subnet | 192.168.1.100 |\n",
    "| Default gateway | Routes to other networks/Internet     | 192.168.1.1   |\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Benefits**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Less broadcast traffic → more efficient.\n",
    "* Better security → separation between groups.\n",
    "* More control → custom rules per subnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Subnet 1:** POS, cash registers, internal devices.\n",
    "* **Subnet 2:** public Wi-Fi.\n",
    "  → Both access the Internet via the same router but stay isolated from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. ARP – Address Resolution Protocol**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Purpose:** maps **IP addresses to MAC addresses** so devices can communicate locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **How it works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Host A doesn’t know the MAC of 192.168.1.50 → sends ARP Request (“Who has 192.168.1.50?”) in **broadcast**.\n",
    "  2. The target replies with its MAC address (ARP Reply → **unicast**).\n",
    "  3. Host A saves the IP–MAC pair in its **ARP cache**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Useful Commands:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `arp -a` (Windows/macOS/Linux) → shows ARP cache.\n",
    "  * `ip neigh` (Linux modern systems).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Note:** ARP works only within the same local network (Layer 2).\n",
    "  For communication across networks, a **router** is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. DHCP – Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Purpose:** automatically assigns IP addresses to devices.\n",
    "* **Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **DHCP Discover:** the device searches for a DHCP server.\n",
    "  2. **DHCP Offer:** the server offers an IP address.\n",
    "  3. **DHCP Request:** the device requests that offered IP.\n",
    "  4. **DHCP ACK:** the server confirms the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "→ The device can now use the assigned IP address.\n",
    "\n",
