    "* Write down your **original MAC** (`ip link show eth0`) **first** so you always have it ready.\n",
    "* Spoof MACs **only in the VM** (not on your host) when doing labs.\n",
    "* After spoofing, use `dhclient -v eth0` to get an IP.\n",
    "* If the lab page is accessible via the View Site button, **try copying the MAC shown on the page first** — sometimes it's the quick solution.\n",
    "* Use `curl` to extract flags quickly (useful if the browser has active protections).\n",
    "* Always restore the original MAC at the end to avoid network conflicts."
