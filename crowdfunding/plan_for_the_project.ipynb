    "### ✅ **PHASE 1 — Pre-Launch (Now)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal: Build a follower base, test content, and generate curiosity.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Create and publish the Pre-Launch Page** with a clear title, striking image, and evocative description. Share the URL everywhere and aim for your first 10 real followers to activate the public counter.\n",
    "2.  **Tell the project's story through 5-10 micro-narratives:** its origin, \"silence as a language,\" its connection to AI and glitch art, your personal journey, and the vision of E-C-H-O Systems.\n",
    "3.  **Prepare cyclical content:** a short trailer, glitch images, sound clips, milestone GIFs (25%, 50%, 100%), and devlog articles.\n",
    "4.  **Write personalized messages** for friends, contacts, and fans, asking them to follow, share, and act as ambassadors. Track their responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **PHASE 2 — Network Building**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal: Amplify the project beyond your immediate network.**\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Identify 10-15 niche press contacts** in indie games, AI Art, glitch/cyberpunk, and Italian creative scenes.\n",
    "6.  **Create an essential press kit** with a title/description, trailer, high-res images, quotes, credits, key dates, and optional exclusive content.\n",
    "7.  **Write a personalized press pitch** that is short, direct, and explains why *they* should cover it. Send it only after incorporating pre-launch feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **PHASE 3 — Launch Optimization**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal: Prepare all materials and the final launch strategy.**\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  **Follow the \"12-point pre-launch checklist\":** verified identity, realistic funding goal, proofread text, coherent rewards, pre-written FAQs, and an optimized project video (under 2 minutes, clear, emotional).\n",
    "9.  **Prepare pre-campaign updates** with mini-posts every 3-4 days on your blog/LinkedIn/Instagram. Engage followers with polls, Q&As, and glitch teasers.\n",
    "10. **Consider Ads (optional but powerful)** if you have a trailer/visuals and at least 40 followers. A test budget of €100-200 on Meta can drive traffic to your Pre-Launch Page.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **PHASE 4 — Campaign Management (When Live)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal: Maintain campaign momentum and build trust.**\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Use the Kickstarter Pledge Manager** to handle digital rewards (PDF artbook, Terminal access, OST), offer add-ons (WAV audio packs, secret mini-games), and accept late pledges.\n",
    "12. **Organize digital distribution** using Itch.io for the game, DriveThruRPG/Bandcamp for audio, and Pledgebox for any backer surveys/data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **PHASE 5 — Aiming for \"Projects We Love\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal: Get selected by Kickstarter for extra visibility.**\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **Refine your Pre-Launch Page and content** to ensure a unique style, strong narrative, and impeccable presentation (title, description, video subtitles, image alt-text).\n",
    "14. **Tag and engage @Kickstarter** by sharing genuine, creative behind-the-scenes content (glitches, sounds, narrative), avoiding spammy link-dumping.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "You already have the vision, consistency, and tone to stand out on Kickstarter. Now we just need to translate this into **concrete, cyclical actions**, working at your pace but keeping the energy high.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me know if you would like:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   An **interactive dashboard (e.g., Google Sheet or Notion)** with all these steps and a progress tracker.\n",
    "*   To **write the first social posts or follower messages** together.\n",
    "*   To plan a **pre-launch editorial calendar from now until December/January**.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am ready to build this with you."
