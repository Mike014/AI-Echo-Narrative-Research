    "# MDA Framework — *Fractured Identity (Narrative Prototype)*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The game is designed as an interactive narrative experience in the style of *Bandersnatch*. Each scene represents a fragment of the protagonist's psyche. The player's choices modify the attributes, causing the personality to converge towards one of three parts: Lucid, Fragmented, or Dark. The peculiarity is that the **ENTITY** is not a scripted NPC, but an **agentic AI agent**, which uses **silence and pacing disruptions** as actual narrative actions.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **I** → fragile and unstable protagonist\n",
    "* **CONSCIOUSNESS** → protective, rational part\n",

    "\n",
    "**Attributes**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sanity** → clarity of perception\n",
    "* **Memory** → continuity of self\n",
    "* **Control** → agency vs. submission\n",
    "* **Bond** → relationship with CONSCIOUSNESS\n",
    "* **Shadow** → influence of the ENTITY\n",

    "**States**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lucid Side** → stability and protection\n",
    "* **Fragmented Side** → unstable oscillation\n",

    "* **Illusion of Control** → the player feels free to choose, but ENTITY manipulates timing and responses\n",
    "* **Unstable Triangulation** → I is torn between CONSCIOUSNESS and ENTITY\n",
    "* **Active Silence** → ENTITY chooses when to remain silent, transforming waiting into tension\n",
    "* **Rhythm Breaks** → in metronarrative scenes, ENTITY destabilizes by interrupting the flow of music\n",
    "* **Meta-Disruption** → glitches, notifications, and file intrusions that simulate system invasion\n",
