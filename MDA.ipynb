    "# MDA Framework — *Dialogues with an Echo* (v0.1 - Prototype)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: This is the first formal MDA documentation for a prototypical system. Many mechanics are still in flux and will be refined through iteration. The **Metronarrative** approach described here represents an experimental direction rather than a finalized design pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mechanics (system levers)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Actors**: \n",
    "  - IO (fragmented diary voice)\n",
    "  - COSCIENZA (stabilizing rational presence)\n",
    "  - ENTITÀ (autonomous antagonist with temporal agency)\n",
    "  - EntityDirector (sandboxed system-level director)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **States/FSM (ENTITÀ)**: \n",
    "  - Emotional states: `curious | bored | irritated` with hysteresis\n",
    "  - Temporal controls: cooldown periods, silence/tension EMAs, speak-rate regulation\n",
    "  - Decision system: probabilistic gating with noise injection\n",
    "  - *(Note: These parameters are tuned per-scene and remain under active development)*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Memory**: \n",
    "  - Rolling buffer maintaining recent IO/ENTITÀ exchanges for immediate contextual coherence\n",
    "  - *(Future iterations may explore longer-term semantic memory)*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Space**: \n",
    "  - Primary: textual/audio interaction space\n",
    "  - Secondary (Act IV): simulated OS-level intrusions (notifications, file events)\n",
    "  - All system intrusions are sandboxed and opt-in\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Audio/Tempo → Metronarrative (experimental)**\n",
    "  - **Beat grid**: Dialogue events quantized to musical tempo\n",
    "  - **Scheduling**: Lines assigned to on-beat (authoritative), off-beat (disruptive), or rest (silence as content)\n",
    "  - **Breaks**: Deliberate ruptures outside the grid for psychological disruption\n",
    "  - **Guiding track**: Each scene defines tempo/pattern; music becomes narrative conductor\n",
    "  - *(This synchronization approach is still being refined and may evolve significantly)*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Safety**: \n",
    "  - All OS-like effects confined to `./sandbox/` directory\n",
    "  - System intrusions are opt-in with clear consent mechanisms\n",
    "  - Content warnings provided upfront\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dynamics (emergent behaviors)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Musical cadence**: Dialogue rhythm tied to beat structure; waiting becomes intentional pause rather than dead air\n",
    "* **Syncopated tension**: ENTITÀ exploits both on-beat authority and off-beat disruption\n",
    "* **Unstable triangulation**: IO and COSCIENZA seek meaning while ENTITÀ destabilizes through selective intervention\n",
    "* **Attention displacement**: OS-like interruptions occur between beats, forcing focus shifts outside narrative frame\n",
    "* *(These patterns emerged through testing but may behave differently with alternate tempo/content configurations)*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Aesthetics (player experience)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Narrative/Discovery**: Identity fragmentation revealed through both semantic content and rhythmic placement\n",
    "* **Sensation/Unease**: Controlled psychological discomfort through beat, silence, and glitch\n",
    "* **Contemplation/Submission**: Player as listener/observer more than active decision-maker\n",
    "* **Projection**: Identification with fragmented IO through tempo-synchronized phrasing\n",
    "* *(User experience metrics are preliminary and based on limited internal testing)*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Four Operational Pillars\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1) Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand the psychological triad (IO, COSCIENZA, ENTITÀ) through combined semantic and rhythmic signals\n",
    "* Recognize silence as meaningful rest, not system failure\n",
    "* Experience ENTITÀ as genuinely autonomous through unpredictable temporal choices\n",
    "* Follow narrative arc: echo → selective voice → frame rupture → identity convergence (IO → LUI)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential tuning metrics** (not yet formally tracked):\n",
    "- Percentage of lines on-beat vs off-beat\n",
    "- Density of intrusions per musical measure\n",
    "- Words-per-beat ratio\n",
    "- Average time between ENTITÀ interventions\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2) Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "**Operational (player-facing)**:\n",
    "- Type to input; system responds according to scene tempo\n",
    "- Optional: enable/disable OS-like effects\n",
    "- Standard controls: pause, exit\n",
    "- Scenes advance according to musical timing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constitutive (engine-level)**:\n",
    "- **Gating formula**: `p = base + α·tensionEMA + β·silenceEMA + bias(emotionalState) + boost(silenceThresholds) + rateTerm + noise`\n",
    "- **Quantization**: Speech windows aligned to beat grid; off-beat slots reserved for glitch/intrusion\n",
    "- **Validation**: 6-16 words, terminal punctuation, tone consistency, duplicate suppression\n",
    "- *(Parameter values are scene-specific and subject to revision)*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implicit (ethical/social)**:\n",
    "- Silence carries narrative weight\n",
    "- OS intrusions respect user consent and sandbox boundaries\n",
    "- Content warnings precede sensitive material\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3) Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Visual**: Glitch-rendered text synchronized to beat or syncopation\n",
    "* **Audio**: Music/metronome as narrative conductor; dynamic swells and stings\n",
    "* **Anticipatory**: Subtle glitch/noise hints before ENTITÀ speaks\n",
    "* **Systemic**: OS-like notifications between beats\n",
    "* **Structural**: Hard cuts (e.g., \"WHAT AM I?\") as narrative punctuation\n",
    "* *(Feedback mechanisms are functional but may require refinement based on user testing)*\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4) Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Player decisions**:\n",
    "- When to input (in rhythm or against it)\n",
    "- Whether to enable system intrusion effects\n",
    "- Whether to continue or exit\n",
    "\n",
    "**ENTITÀ decisions**:\n",
    "- Speak on-beat (authoritative statement)\n",
    "- Speak off-beat (disruptive intervention)\n",
    "- Remain silent (meaningful rest)\n",
    "- Force break outside grid (shock/reset)\n",

    "## Appendix — Metronarrative (Experimental Framework)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metronarrative** is an experimental approach to digital storytelling being explored in this prototype, where **narrative events are synchronized to a musical beat grid**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core concepts**:\n",
    "- **On-beat**: Privileged timing for authoritative statements\n",
    "- **Rest**: Silence as intentional narrative content\n",
    "- **Off-beat**: Glitches, intrusions, and syncopated disturbances\n",
    "- **Breaks**: Deliberate ruptures outside the grid for psychological shock\n",
    "\n",
    "**Distinction from existing approaches**:\n",
    "While rhythm games and some visual novels incorporate musical synchronization, this prototype applies tempo-based scheduling specifically to **psychodrama and autonomous AI behavior**. Rather than treating music as accompaniment, the beat grid becomes a mechanical constraint that shapes when and how narrative agents can intervene.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Status**: This remains a prototype-stage exploration. The effectiveness and broader applicability of Metronarrative as a design pattern requires further testing, iteration, and comparative analysis with existing narrative-musical integration techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Future development**:\n",
    "- Formal user studies to measure engagement vs. discomfort\n",
    "- Exploration of variable tempo/time signature effects\n",
    "- Investigation of whether this approach generalizes beyond trauma/psychological narratives\n",
    "- Comparison with existing rhythm-based narrative systems\n",

    "**Document Version**: 0.1 (Prototype Stage)  \n",
    "**Last Updated**: 2025-09-29  \n",
    "**Status**: Active development; mechanics subject to revision\n"
