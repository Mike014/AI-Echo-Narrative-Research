# **GAME DESIGN PHILOSOPHY — Michele Grimaldi (Draft)**

### **Core Principle**

A game must pose a fundamental question about the human experience — and become the answer to that question through every single one of its elements.

## **Manifesto of Necessary Coherence**

### **Beyond the Collage**

* Reject superficial eclecticism in favor of an organic identity.
* Every influence must be digested and transformed into something *necessary*.
* Authenticity is greater than novelty — originality is born from inner coherence, not accumulation.

### **Internal Urgency**

Visuals, sounds, rules, and levels must *do* something — change a state, a decision, or the player’s perception.
Anything that doesn’t alter the world, the system, or the mind is decoration.

### **From System to Soul**

When all elements converge toward a single emotional and conceptual axis, the player no longer consumes an experience — they inhabit it.

## **Transformative Goal**

To create experiences that:

* Persist beyond the final credits.
* Leave the player in a state of contemplative suspension.
* Feel *lived through*, not merely *played*.
* Transcend entertainment to become tools for reflection and awareness.

> **“The value of a game is measured by the silence it leaves behind.”**
