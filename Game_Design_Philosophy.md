# **GAME DESIGN PHILOSOPHY — Michele Grimaldi (Draft)**

### **Core Principle**

A game must pose a fundamental question about the human experience — and become the answer to that question through every single one of its elements.

---

## **Manifesto of Necessary Coherence**

### **Beyond the Collage**

* Reject superficial eclecticism in favor of an organic identity.
* Every influence must be digested and transformed into something *necessary*.
* Authenticity is greater than novelty — originality is born from inner coherence, not accumulation.

### **Internal Urgency**

Visuals, sounds, rules, and levels must *do* something — change a state, a decision, or the player’s perception.
Anything that doesn’t alter the world, the system, or the mind is decoration.

### **From System to Soul**

When all elements converge toward a single emotional and conceptual axis, the player no longer consumes an experience — they inhabit it.

---

## **Transformative Goal**

To create experiences that:

* Persist beyond the final credits.
* Leave the player in a state of contemplative suspension.
* Feel *lived through*, not merely *played*.
* Transcend entertainment to become tools for reflection and awareness.

> **“The value of a game is measured by the silence it leaves behind.”**

## **Operational Principles**

### **Convergence Test**

1. **Cause → Effect:** Does this scene or mechanic produce a tangible consequence (in story, system, or resources)?
2. **Theme → Interaction:** Does the theme manifest through player choice, or only through imagery?
3. **World → Rules:** Does the setting affect affordances, paths, or risks?
4. **Residue:** What remains in the player’s mind ten minutes later — memory, concept, or just “wow”?

### **State-Change Rule**

If an element doesn’t change a **state** — of the world, character, UI, resources, or the player’s mind — it is ornamental.
Cut it, or re-purpose it.

### **Pacing as Decision Density**

Rhythm isn’t measured in distance or duration, but in the number and significance of meaningful decisions per minute.

### **The Ludonarrative Contract**

Every game opens with a promise — a tone, a fantasy, a role.
Halfway through, that promise must be tested.
By the end, it must be fulfilled or consciously broken.
Any set piece that doesn’t serve this contract is noise.

### **Silence as a Mechanic**

Silence must have *consequence*:
in silence, risk grows, perception shifts, systems reconfigure.
Silence is not absence — it’s pressure, tension, truth.

## **For Application**

Include this philosophy at the top of your design documents and link one example for each principle — a clip, prototype, or mechanic that demonstrates “state change.”
During playtests, ask:

> “What changed for you here?”
> If testers can’t answer in five seconds, the scene isn’t yet *necessary*.
