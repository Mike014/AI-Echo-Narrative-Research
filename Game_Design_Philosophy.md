**GAME DESIGN PHILOSOPHY**
**Michele Grimaldi - Draft**

**Core Principle**
A game must pose a fundamental question about the human experience, and become the answer to that question through every single one of its elements.

**Manifesto of Absolute Coherence**

**Beyond the Collage of References**
 *   Reject superficial eclecticism in favor of an organic identity.
 *   Every influence must be digested and transformed into something necessary.
 *   Originality stems from authenticity, not novelty.
    
**Transformative Goal**
To create experiences that:
*   Persist beyond the final credits.
*   Leave the player in a state of contemplative suspension.
*   Evoke the feeling of having lived through something unique and irreplicable.
*   Transcend entertainment to become tools for existential reflection.

*"The value of a game is measured by the silence it leaves behind."*
