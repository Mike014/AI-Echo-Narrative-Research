    "\n",
    "* **The designer creates experiences, not objects.** The artifact (rules, systems, UI, assets, code) is the means; the designer is judged on the experience it induces.\n",
    "* **We do not directly control experiences:** we shape the artifact to **induce** desired states.\n",

    "# 1) Lens #1 — The Lens of Emotion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Guiding Questions**\n",
    "* What emotions do I want to evoke? Why?\n",
    "* What emotions do I currently see in players? Why?\n",
    "* How can I bridge the gap between the desired and the actual? (By changing rules, feedback, pacing, aesthetics, challenge?)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2) Lens #2 — The Lens of Essential Experience\n",
    "\n",
    "**Principle**\n",
    "* The goal isn't to replicate reality, but to **capture its essence** (the defining elements) and discard accidental details.\n",
    "* Example \"snowball fight\": the **cold** could emerge from visuals (condensation, shivering), audio (wind), or even **rules** (bare hands = better throws but risk of \"freezing\").\n",
    "\n",
    "**Guiding Questions**\n",
    "* What experience do I want the player to have?\n",
    "* What is **essential** to that experience?\n",
    "* How does my game **capture** that essence?\n",
    "* If there's a gap between the desired and actual experience, **I change the game**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: A designed experience can feel **more \"real\" than everyday life**.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3) Methods for Designing Experience\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Psychology:**\n",
    "  * *Behaviorism* (measurable, repeatable): A/B testing, telemetry, controlled experiments.\n",
    "  * *Phenomenology* (subjective): introspection, usage diaries, qualitative interviews.\n",
    "    → The designer can and should use **both**.\n",
    "* **Cultural Anthropology:** \"Field work\" with players; immerse, observe, interview, understand meanings from the inside.\n",
    "* **Cross-Disciplinary Design:** Build bridges to music, architecture, film, choreography, UI/UX... to import **empirical rules** and patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4) Games as Problem Solving (and the \"Magic Circle\")\n",
    "\n",
    "* A game is (also) **a problem-solving activity, approached with a playful attitude**.\n",
    "* The brain constructs a **closed micro-reality** with goals and rules: this is the origin of the **\"magic circle\"** and endogenous value (what matters in the game because it matters for winning/progressing).\n",
    "* Even atypical cases (gambling, *War*) activate attempts at control until the inevitability of chance is learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5) The Elemental Tetrad (All are Indispensable)\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Mechanics** — Rules/procedures/goals; they distinguish games from linear media.\n",
    "    * Must be supported by technology, made clear by aesthetics, and meaningful in the story.\n",
    "2.  **Story** — A sequence of events (linear/branching/emergent); choose mechanics that **reinforce it** and allow for narrative emergence; aesthetics/technology support its tone and pace.\n",
    "3.  **Aesthetics** — Look, sound, feel; the most direct channel to the experience; must be **orchestrated** and coherent with mechanics and story.\n",
    "4.  **Technology** — The medium/platform (paper, engine, hardware); enables constraints and possibilities; it is the **medium** where aesthetics, mechanics, and story occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "> No single element is \"more important\": there is a **gradient of visibility** (Technology least visible, Aesthetics most visible), but strength comes from **overall coherence**.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6) Artifact vs. Experience\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Artifact**: Rules, systems, UI, assets, code (what you make).\n",
    "* **Experience**: Perceptions, emotions, sense of control, meaning, memory (what the player lives).\n",
    "* If no one plays, only the object exists; **the experience does not exist**.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7) Playtest — Application to *Dialoghi con un'Eco: Terminal*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Automate functionality** (pytest/Selenium) to free up time for experiential tuning.\n",
    "* **\"Essential but open\" rules**: Coherent with the game's philosophy, allowing for player interpretation, enhancing immersion.\n",
    "* **Explicit experiential hypotheses for each mechanic**:\n",
    "  * \"This rule should induce ___ because ___; we verify it by observing ___ and measuring ___.\"\n",
    "* **Verification cycles**: Qualitative observation (phenomenology) + metrics/behaviors (behaviorism).\n",
    "* **Success criterion**: Reduction of the **Emotions gap** (Lens #1) and alignment with the **essence** (Lens #2).\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8) Definitions as Thinking Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "* They serve to **clarify ideas**, not to rigidly fix terms. If a definition doesn't aid design, change it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operational Check-list (Quick)\n",
    "\n",
    "* [ ] **Lens #1**: List desired vs. observed emotions → define actions to bridge the gap.\n",
    "* [ ] **Lens #2**: Declare the **essence** (3–5 points) → map how each element of the tetrad conveys it.\n",
    "* [ ] **Tetrad**: Verify mutual coherence (mechanics, story, aesthetics, technology).\n",
    "* [ ] **Hypothesis per mechanic** → qualitative + quantitative tests.\n",
    "* [ ] **Refactor** the artifact guided by the experience (not the other way around).\n",
    "* [ ] **Re-evaluation**: Is the current experience closer to the essence? If not, iterate."
