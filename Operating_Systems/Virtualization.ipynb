    "## **\"The Abstraction: The Process.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **process** is the fundamental abstraction: a running program. The OS provides the illusion of many **virtual CPUs** on a few physical CPUs through **time sharing**; **mechanisms** are low-level (e.g., context switch), and **policies** decide which process to run.\n",
    "The **machine state** of a process includes its **address space** (code, static data, heap, stack), **registers** (PC/IP, SP, frame pointer), and **I/O information** (open files).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Process API (Typical Interface)\n",
    "* **create** (creation)\n",
    "* **destroy/kill**\n",
    "* **wait** (wait for termination)\n",
    "* Various controls (**suspend/resume**)\n",
    "* **status** (CPU time, state)\n",
    "\n",
    "## From Executable to Process\n",
    "The OS loads the code and static data into memory (**eager** or **lazy**), allocates and initializes the **stack** (e.g., *argc/argv*), prepares the **heap** (for *malloc()*), sets up the standard **file descriptors** (*stdin/out/err*), and starts execution at *main()*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Process States\n",
    "* **Running** (on the CPU)\n",
    "* **Ready** (ready but not executing)\n",
    "* **Blocked** (waiting for an event, e.g., I/O)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transitions**: **schedule** (ready → running), **deschedule** (running → ready); upon I/O completion: blocked → ready. Examples show how the OS maintains high **CPU utilization** by running another process during I/O.\n",
    "\n",
    "## OS Data Structures\n",
    "The OS uses a **process list** with a **PCB** (Process Control Block) for each process. In *xv6*, the *struct proc* contains: register context for the context switch, state, PID, pointers to open files, current directory, trapframe, etc. Additional states include **UNUSED/EMBRYO/SLEEPING/RUNNABLE/RUNNING/ZOMBIE** (useful to allow the parent to call *wait()* and collect the exit code).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Principles\n",
    "* **Separation of policy/mechanism** (changing the scheduling algorithm without touching the context switch)\n",
    "* **Time sharing vs. space sharing** (CPU is shared over time; disk is typically shared over space).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the chapter defines what a process is, how the OS creates and manages it, which states it transitions through, and what data the OS maintains, laying the groundwork for understanding **CPU virtualization** and **scheduling** in subsequent chapters.\n",

    "# **What is a process?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **process** is not \"an executing resource,\" but a **running instance** of a program with its **execution context**: memory (stack/heap), registers, file descriptors, environment variables, permissions, state, etc. It is the unit that the operating system schedules on the CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "# `fork()`, `exec()`, `wait()` — what are they?\n",
    "\n",
    "They are **POSIX system calls**, i.e., functions exposed by the **operating system** that a process can invoke.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`fork()`** – *duplicates the process*\n",
    "Creates a **child** almost identical to the **parent** (same code, copy of the context).\n",
    "Different returns: to the parent → **child PID**; to the child → **0**.\n",
    "Side effect: without coordination, the print/progress order is **non-deterministic**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`exec()`** – *replaces the program in the process*\n",
    "Doesn't create a new process: it **replaces** the code and segments of the **current process** with a **new program** (executable). If successful, it **doesn't return** (continue inside the new program).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`wait()` / `waitpid()`** – *synchronizes and cleans up*\n",
    "The **parent** blocks until a **child** exits; this makes the order **deterministic** and “collects” its exit status (avoiding **zombies**).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why separate `fork()` and `exec()`\n",
    "\n",
    "To make room for the **setup** between the two steps. This is the heart of how **shells** (bash, zsh) work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The shell does `fork()` → now it has a **child** it can “tweak” without affecting itself.\n",
    "2. In the child, it does the **preparations**: redirections (`dup2` to `STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR`), setting environment variables, pipe management, `chdir`, `setpgid`, resource limitations, etc.\n",
    "3. Then it calls `exec()` to **load the actual command** (e.g., `ls`, `python`, `ffmpeg`).\n",
    "4. In the **parent** (the shell), a `wait()` “waits” for that child to know when it's finished and its exit code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This separation allows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Redirections**: `cmd > out.txt` (the child points `STDOUT` to the file, then `exec()`).\n",
    "* **Pipe**: `A | B` (the shell creates a pipe, connecting `stdout` of A to `stdin` of B between `fork()` and `exec()`).\n",
    "* **Isolation**: changes only in the child; The shell remains clean for the next command.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are system calls that a process invokes. They are not \"process functions\" in the OO sense; they are kernel APIs for creating, replacing, and synchronizing processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mini mental flow (one line)\n",
    "\n",
    "`fork()` (child is created) → [setup in child] → `exec()` (runs real program) → `wait()` in parent (synchronizes and reads exit code).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. fork() = creates a worker (child),\n",
    "\n",
    "2. between the two steps = gives it the right tools (redirections, pipes, env),\n",
    "\n",
    "3. exec() = the worker becomes the specialist who does the work (the actual program),\n",
    "\n",
    "4. wait() = the boss decides whether to wait for the report or immediately move on to another order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting a program = creating a new instance (process) that loads and runs that program; this instance is what actually does the work, not the original file on disk.\n",
