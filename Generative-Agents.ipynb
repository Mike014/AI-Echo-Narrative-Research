    "# Generative Agents Structure - \n",
    "\n",
    "A generative agent is an orchestrated LLM with an architecture that adds three fundamental modules: Memory, Reflection, and Planning.\n",
    "Together, these allow the agent to perceive → remember → reason → plan → act → update itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Memory Stream\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is a chronological database in natural language that records:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Observations → what the agent perceives or does (“Maria drinks a coffee”).\n",
    "* Reflections → more abstract summaries (“Maria is passionate about studying”).\n",
    "* **Plans** → future actions (“Work on the paper tomorrow at 9”).\n",
    "* Each record has: text, creation timestamp, and last access timestamp.\n",
    "* Function: provides continuity and identity to the agent over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieval (how to select relevant memories)\n",
    "\n",
    "The system does not pass all memory to the LLM, but uses three criteria to select the most useful memories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Recency** → priority given to recent events (exponential decay).\n",
    "2. **Importance** → score 1–10 (assigned by the LLM) to distinguish trivial from salient events (e.g., “have breakfast” = 2; “ask the crush out” = 8).\n",
    "3. **Relevance** → calculated with embeddings and cosine similarity between the current query and the memories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final score is a combination of the three factors.\n",
    "The top-ranked memories enter the **prompt context** → from there the LLM produces the response/action.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. **Reflection**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Allows you to **abstract from the raw data** and create more general thoughts.\n",
    "* Generated periodically (e.g., when the sum of recent importance scores > 150).\n",
    "* Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The LLM receives the latest ~100 memories.\n",
    "2. Asks high-level questions (“What is Klaus’s passion?”).\n",
    "3. Retrieves the most relevant memories and produces **insights** with quotes (“Klaus is passionate about research because: \\[1,2,8]”).\n",
    "* Reflections become **nodes of a tree**: leaves = observations → branches = concepts → roots = more abstract inferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function: Creates **stable identity** and coherent relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. **Planning**\n",
    "\n",
    "* It helps maintain **temporal coherence** and avoid short-sighted or repetitive behavior.\n",
    "* Hierarchical structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Daily plan in macro-blocks** (5–8 parts: wake up, lessons, lunch, study, dinner).\n",
    "* **Hourly breakdown** (e.g., from 1 to 5 pm I work on the paper → broken down into subtasks).\n",
    "* **Minutes breakdown** (e.g., 1:00 pm brainstorming → 2:30 pm writing introduction → 3:00 pm break).\n",
    "* Plans are saved in memory along with observations and reflections.\n",
    "* **Re-planning**: if something changes (e.g., a party invitation, an unexpected event), the agent can update the plan only as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. **Reaction (adaptation)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* With each tick, the agent perceives new observations → decides whether to continue with the plan or react.\n",
    "* Ex: John sees Eddy in the garden → instead of ignoring him, he updates the plan and engages him in a dialogue.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. **Dialogue (conversation)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Generated by conditioning sentences on the **set of relevant memories** relating to the interlocutor.\n",
    "* Each line is produced sequentially, but the authors suggest generating it in batches as an optimization (more fluid and less expensive dialogues).\n",
    "* Maintains **relational coherence** (roles: father/son, friends, colleagues).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. **Grounding in the environment**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The world is represented as a **tree of areas and objects** (e.g., House → Kitchen → Stove).\n",
    "* The agent only knows the subgraphs it has explored.\n",
    "* For each action, the LLM decides the area → sub-area → object → the engine performs pathfinding and updates the state.\n",
    "* Ex: \"making an espresso\" → changes the machine state from \"idle\" to \"brewing\".\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. **Optimizations**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cache of **agent summaries** (identity, occupation, current state).\n",
    "* Plan generated only at a high level, details in real time.\n",
    "* Possible **batching** of dialogues and **parallelization** of agents for speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. **Operational Loop**\n",
    "\n",
    "The cognitive cycle of an agent is:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Perceive → Record observations → Retrieve from memory stream → Generate action/plan → Update memory with action and reflection → Act in the world → Repeat**.\n",

    "A **generative agent** = LLM (brain) + orchestrator + persistent memory + action environment.\n",

    "- **Stream**: Complete archive of observations, plans, reflections\n",
    "- **Retrieval**: Filters by Relevance, Recency, Importance\n",
    "- Only the most useful information goes to the LLM as context\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Reflection\n",
    "- Transforms events into insights (identity, preferences, relationships)\n",
    "- Activates periodically or at importance thresholds\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Planning\n",
    "- Hierarchical plans: day → hours → minutes\n",
    "- Partial replanning when conditions change\n",
