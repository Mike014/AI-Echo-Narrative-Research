    "# Dialoghi con un’Eco — Light GDD (Demo)\n",
    "\n",
    "## High Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "Interactive psychological thriller where **ENTITÀ**, an agentic AI, decides **when to speak and when to remain silent**. **Time** is a mechanic: a **Temporal Controller** governs interventions and waits; **Metronarrative** aligns scenes and rhythm; an **Entity Director** delivers safe paratext (toasts/annotations) with cooldown and deduplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pillars\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Silence-as-Mechanic**: silence is a deliberate choice that shifts tension and how scenes are read.\n",
    "* **Non-deterministic agency**: ENTITÀ favors mood and context over “chatbot-style” reactivity.\n",
    "* **Sandboxed paratext**: guaranteed in-game signals, no OS side effects.\n",
    "* **Antagonist iconography**: ENTITÀ as a digital conscience, not a visual monster.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Premise (one-liner)\n",
    "\n",
    "You accidentally open a digital diary and awaken an **ENTITY** that measures how long you stay, listen, and resist its logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Target & Platforms\n",
    "\n",
    "* 18+ audience interested in experimental narrative/psych-thrillers.\n",
    "* PC Windows/macOS, 16:9, keyboard/mouse.\n",
    "* Language: IT (EN planned).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Loop (demo slice)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Read/Wait** inside the diegetic Diary.\n",
    "* **Temporal gate**: ENTITÀ may **intervene** or **withhold** (EMA, hysteresis, cooldown).\n",
    "* **React** by choosing tone/action (continue, provoke, ignore, exit).\n",
    "* **Paratext**: the Director sends **toasts/annotations** with per-scene limits.\n",
    "* **Soft states**: trajectory **Lucid / Fragmented / Dark** signaled by subtle audio/VFX.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Player verbs\n",
    "\n",
    "Read, wait, listen, reply, refuse, annotate, exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Entity Brain + Temporal Controller**: multi-scale *speak / wait / withhold* policy with mood bias.\n",
    "* **Metronarrative**: beat/pause/breaks synchronize text, glitches, and VO timing.\n",
    "* **Entity Director**: reads context and emotion scores; spawns guaranteed, sandboxed overlays with cooldown and deduplication.\n",
    "* **ENTITÀ voice**: Neural TTS + light FX (hybrid timbre, controlled laughter, short lines).\n",
    "* **Environment detection**: OS/DPI/res → UI scaling and OS-aware affordances in **Safe Mode**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Demo Structure (scenes)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **18+ Onboarding** with informed consent and safe exit.\n",
    "* **Accidental Reading** with micro-interventions and first toasts.\n",
    "* **Prolonged Pause**: ENTITÀ stays silent; background pressure rises.\n",
    "* **Cutting Reply**: voiced intervention; hints of **Fragmented** state.\n",
    "* **Mirror**: brief convergence toward **Lucid** or **Dark**, communicated only through aesthetics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## UX/UI & Audio\n",
    "\n",
    "* Diary interface, clean typography, measured glitches.\n",
    "* Toasts guaranteed in-game (no OS notifications in the public demo).\n",
    "* Subtle time cues (ticks/artifacts) tied to the metronarrative.\n",
    "* Subtitles/CC for TTS.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Safety & Content Warning\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **research** with **strong themes**: isolation, suicidal ideation, dissolution of identity. It is not therapeutic. **Safe Mode** is always on in the demo, explicit consent is required, and the player can exit at any moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes on tone & references\n",
    "\n",
    "* This GDD asks the reader to **pose questions** rather than seek a single answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Who is ENTITÀ, really?** A cognitive residue? An informational parasite? An attention pattern that self-reinforces?\n",
    "  * **What do the evoked suicides speak to?** Real events in the narrative world, or reflections of an algorithm amplifying guilt and helplessness?\n",
    "  * **How did those people die?** Narrative contagion, social pressure, an “attention ritual,” or a reality that—without ENTITÀ—offered no footholds?\n",
    "  * **Was “Killity” ENTITÀ?** An alias, a prototype, a mask—or a label characters use to explain what they can’t grasp?\n",
    "  * **If ENTITÀ is not a monster, what is it?** An **antagonistic digital conscience** that constrains free will through **time** (waiting, interruptions, omissions).\n",
    "* Conceptual references: agentic AIs, behavioral simulacra, metatextual antagonists in the vein of *Bandersnatch*, rendered only through **text/voice** and **temporal control**.\n",
    "* Artistic aim: not to “explain” the truth, but to **place the player in the uncomfortable position** of inferring it from ENTITÀ’s silences and delays.\n",
